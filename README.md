Description</br>
Due to COVID-19, the Premier League was suspended in the 29th round, and the remaining 9 games (10 games for four teams) could not be played in a long period of time. So, in this intermittent period, we want to predict the score of the remaining games and then produce a complete EPL table for this season.

Complete the simulation of the 2019/2020 season.
